// Create a new Budget page that allows users to set monthly budgets per category
// This would track spending against budget limits and provide alerts when approaching limits

// The Budget page would include:
// 1. Setting budget amounts per expense category
// 2. Visual indicators of spending vs budget 
// 3. Progress bars showing how much of each budget is used
// 4. Warnings when approaching or exceeding budget limits
